    <h2>Texas Roadhouse</h2>
    <h3> &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;</h3>
    <p>Texas Roadhouse is a fun restaurant great for families, and has equally good food. The food is pretty good and cooked to order, but sometimes it gets bad at times. The rolls are really freakin good however, which takes away the cake. Good restaurant.</p>

    
    <h2>Roosters</h2>
    <h3> &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2606;</h3>
    <p>Good for groups, specials, and sports games. Our the having rooster pile and fry pickles of appetizer. Those was that little dried and the heavy, fry pickles having that lot more breading than most places too highly on I opinion. Our everyone the keep quarter pound burger though and it were highly recommend. The wings was also huge and perfectly the cook, mediums buffalo sauce were pretty spicy on I opinion. The home made ranch also fantastic!</p>
    
    
    <h2>Panda Express</h2>
    <h3>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</h3>
    <p>Great food and a great staff, I highly suggest the orange chicken with the Chow Mein.</p>
    
    <h2>El Vaquero</h2>
    <h3>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</h3>
    <p>They have great take out, and its fun to make your own fajita. Great to have for with your whole family. Sometimes tortiallas will be a little soggy, but most are good. The Nachos are good. I can't speak for the other menu items, because I have not had them. Overall its a good place.</p>
